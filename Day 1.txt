Day 1:         Introduction to Browser & web




Task :


1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2.


        -> HTTP : Stands for Hyper  Text  Transfer Protocol  
        


HTTP 1 / HTTP 1.1  - 


Protocol : Textual and one request at a time (Head of line).


Speed : Slower


Features: Optimisation such as sprinting , inlining , domain shrading and concatenating is     provided.


Status code: This protocol introduces a warning header field to carry additional information about the status of a message. It can define 24 status codes, error reporting is quicker and more efficient.




         HTTP 2 - 


Protocol : Binary protocol i.e uses 1’s and 0’s to execute the task. Concept of multiplexing is introduced.


Speed : Faster


Features:This protocol version removes the need for unnecessary optimization hacks.


Status code: It brings the fundamental semantics of HTTP like headers, and status code remains the same.

2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
 -> Object in Java script -  Is an unique entity having state and behavior (properties and method). i.e          representation of real world entities by defining it properties along with their values. Hence everything is an object.


There are three ways to create an object in Java Script
1. By object literal -
Syntax : object={property1:value,
property2:value2
.....property N:valueN} 
        Example : stud={id:001,name:"Bhargav ",course:”FSD”}
// above code creates an object stud with properties id, name, course and corresponding values (assigned after colon symbol” : “)  
2. By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword)-
        Syntax : var objectname=new Object();  
        Example:
var stud=new Object();  
stud.id=001;  
stud.name="Bhargav";  
stud.course=”FSD”;  
 // here ,new keyword is used to create an object. 
// hence above code creates an object stud with properties id, name, course and corresponding values.
//here, key in objects are separated by semi colon “ ; “.
3. By using an object constructor (using new keyword) -
Here, you need to create function with arguments. Each argument value can be assigned in the current object by using this keyword
Syntax: objectName= new functionName(attribute1, attribute2, attributeN)
Using construction function-
function stud(id,name,course) // here , we created a function stud with attributes id,name,class to call by value


{  
this.id=id;  
this.name=name;  
this.salary=salary;  //and created object , using “this” keyword we create properties of an object 


}  
s=new stud(001,"Bhargav",”FSD”); //creating constructor of an object and passing values to function
